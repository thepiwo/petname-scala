## Disclaimer

This library is not well tested, use at your own risk.

## Description

http://blog.dustinkirkland.com/2015/01/introducing-petname-libraries-for.html

This utility will generate "pet names", consisting of a random combination of an adverb, adjective, and an animal name. These are useful for unique hostnames or container names, for instance.

As such, PetName tries to follow the tenets of Zooko’s triangle. Names are, **human meaningful**, **decentralized** and **secure**.

## Usage

Currently published to the sonatype snapshots repository.

in build.sbt add
```
resolvers += Resolver.sonatypeRepo("staging")

libraryDependencies += "space.piwo" %% "petname-scala" % "0.2"
```

in code you can 

```
import space.piwo.petname.{Complexity, Petname}

Petname.generate(words = 3, complexity = Complexity.Large)
```
